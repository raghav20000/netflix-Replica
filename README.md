# netflix-Replica
I developed a replica of a movie streaming platform inspired by Netflix. The application allows users to create accounts (sign up) and securely log in (sign in), with all credentials managed through local storage using JavaScript. Users can search and browse a curated, limited collection of movies available on the platform. The front-end structure was built using HTML, while CSS, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS were used to style the website and ensure responsive, modern design across different devices. JavaScript was implemented to manage user authentication, movie search functionality, and dynamic interaction on the platform. This project focuses on front-end development practices and demonstrates my skills in designing interactive, user-friendly web applications.
